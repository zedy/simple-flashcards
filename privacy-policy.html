    <h1>Privacy Policy for Simple Flashcards</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 16, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Simple Flashcards ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles your information.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>
        Simple Flashcards is designed with privacy in mind. All data is stored locally on your device.
    </p>

    <h3>Information Stored Locally</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flashcard Sets:</strong> Names, tags, and emojis you assign to your sets</li>
        <li><strong>Flashcard Cards:</strong> Front and back text content, tags, and associated set information</li>
        <li><strong>App Settings:</strong> Theme preference (light/dark mode) and progress bar visibility setting</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> All of this data is stored exclusively on your device using local storage (AsyncStorage).
        We do not transmit, upload, or sync any of your data to external servers or cloud services.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number, address)</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or telemetry</li>
        <li>Crash reports</li>
        <li>Advertising data</li>
        <li>Cookies or tracking technologies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer any of your data to third parties because we do not collect
        or have access to your data. Your flashcard content remains entirely on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on your device's
        security measures. We recommend:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using device encryption</li>
        <li>Setting a strong device lock screen password</li>
        <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        Your data remains on your device until you:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manually delete flashcard sets or cards within the app</li>
        <li>Uninstall the application</li>
        <li>Clear the app's data through your device settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Upon uninstalling the app, all locally stored data will be permanently removed from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Simple Flashcards is suitable for users of all ages. Since we do not collect any personal information,
        there is no risk to children's privacy. However, we recommend parental guidance for children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Simple Flashcards does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics providers, or advertising
        networks. The app operates entirely offline and does not require an internet connection.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the
        "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes
        acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view all your data within the app</li>
        <li><strong>Modify:</strong> You can edit or update your flashcard content at any time</li>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> You can delete individual cards, entire sets, or uninstall the app to remove all data</li>
        <li><strong>Export:</strong> Currently not supported, but you maintain full ownership of your content</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        Simple Flashcards requires minimal device permissions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save your flashcard sets and settings locally on your device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We do not request any unnecessary permissions such as camera, microphone, contacts, or location access.
    </p>
